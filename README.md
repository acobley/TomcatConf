# TomcatConf
This is the conf files for tomcat 8 and a buildfile that will start Docker servers that a mysql server linked to tomcat.
Edit the tomcat-users.xml to set the password for manageing the server.
I use this at the University of Dundee in the earlystages of AC51041 Devops and Microservices.
